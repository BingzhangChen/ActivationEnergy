This file accompanies the paper entitled "Partitioning the apparent temperature sensitivity: revisiting the difference between autotrophic and heterotrophic protists" submitted to The American Naturalist and introduces each file (including the source data file) used for statistical analysis and plotting. 

*************Metadata for essential files*************************

****Data files*****
Microzoo_23Mar2020.csv: Original data of growth rate ~ temperature of microzooplankton.

NEWphy24Mar2020.Rdata: merged  data of phytoplankton growth rate ~ temperature. This dataset was expanded from Chen & Laws (2017) and Kremer et al. (2017).

lno10523-sup-0008-suppinfo8.csv: original data from Kremer et al. (2017).

Phyto_19Mar2020.csv: phytoplankton data of growth rate ~ temperature expanded from Chen & Laws (2017). 

Data_source_references.docx: the word document containing the references lists of the data sources.

****End of Data files*****


****R scripts*****
prep_data.R: R script used for reading the source data files ('Microzoo_23Mar2020.csv' & 'NEWphy24Mar2020.Rdata') and choose appropriate data that fit the selection criteria (see text for details). It also calculates the relevant information such as mean Boltzmann temperature for each taxon.

Phy_merge.R: R script to merge two phytoplankton datasets from Chen & Laws (2017) and Kremer et al. (2017) and remove the duplicates.

Fig1_E_defin.R: R script to generate Fig. 1 in the paper. 

Fig2.R: R script to generate Fig. 2 in the paper.

Table2.R: R script to generate Table 2 in the main paper. It also contains the code to generate Table S1-S3, Fig. S1 and S2 in the supplements.

****End of R scripts*****
